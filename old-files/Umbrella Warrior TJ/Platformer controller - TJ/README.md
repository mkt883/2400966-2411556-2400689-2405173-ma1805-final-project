## PLAYER CONTROLLER README ##

I found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwWZwS8iBrw which helped me make the base for the platformer controller. 

I thought it was interesting how he did things like use functions in the player object. It helped keep the code more contained.

There were some issues/aspects in the code however which I wanted to improve and adjust such as:
- how you can infinitely jump 
- gravity only applied when you jump (meaning when you walked off of the higher platform you wouldn't fall)
- only jumping in straight lines
