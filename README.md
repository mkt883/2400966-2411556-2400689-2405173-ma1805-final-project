## .        Game Overview

We have created a side scrolling adventure game, reminiscent of early SNES, SEGA Mega Drive hits like Super Mario and Shinobi 2. Our game follows an umbrella wielding ninja warrior as he seeks to avenge a fallen love. He does this by navigating a number of levels and defeating the enemies sent to chase him down. We have chosen a classic 16/8 bit style for this game and kept the colour palette fairly dark in order to convey the tense atmosphere. The art design calls on ancient Japanese architecture, typical of when ninjas were more common.

## . Individual Contributions

### THOMAS 
My contributions to the project were creating the main menu and subsequent screens. I wrote the lore, tutorial and credit screens. I used mouseIsOver, MousePressed and Draw functions to achieve this. To improve formatting, I used arrays for the content of each screen. I also designed the Umbrella Warrior artwork on the main menu and added the rain affect by generating falling rect shapes.

I created the attack action in a simple rectangle format so that we could implement this into our code later. I achieved this by creating player and enemy classes, then using a draw function to create the hitbox and a checkCollision function to determine a hit or miss. A hit will then null the enemy class. I also created a ranged attack which we decided against using for thematic reasons.

## .        Themes 

The main theme of this game is adventure. The Umbrella Warrior has far to go and many enemies in his path. We have opted for a darker tone in order to create intrigue and buy in from the player. Ultimately, we are looking to create a high stakes situation in a very short amount of time. 


## .        Game Design 

Our game is designed to move at a fast pace to convey the urgency of our warrior's quest. The player character is nimble and can move up and down the screen, displaying his training as a ninjitsu. All enemies track the player around each level to increase the pressure to act quickly as you navigate around. At the prototype stage, the focus was more on evasion, but we implemented the attack action in order to make the gameplay more offence driven, opposed to defence. 

We have mapped out a ranged attack mechanic, but have decided against using this to increase the pressure of having to deal with enemies at close quarters.

## .        Narrative Development.

We plan to expand on the narrative of the game by increasing the number of levels/settings, the number of enemy types and including a 'final boss'. Currently the game begins in a cave, moves to a dojo and then moves outside to a nighttime landscape. 

We also discussed that an easter egg for completing the game could be getting to replay as the fallen geisha from the game lore on further playthroughs. This is not something that we will be able to implement given the timeframe and code line limitations. 


## .        Aesthetics

The player is a classic ninja silhouette. The enemy sprites are designed to look like samurai ghosts. We have stylised our maps to look like Japan during the Edo period.

## .         What we would add>>>

Given time, we would have added in the ranged attack action and added some more levels. We liked the idea of creating a final boss level that presented an enemy with more hit points that required a number of attacks to defeat. Another mechanic that we have spoken about is a constraint that requires all enemies to be killed before the player can move to the next level. Thematically, this would lean into the characterâ€™s need for vengeance. With a larger team or studio, we could look to include animated cutscenes between levels. Giving us a chance to further flesh out the narrative. Knowledge of a more cohesive method of working on our code together, could have helped to streamline our building process and allow for further technical advancements.
